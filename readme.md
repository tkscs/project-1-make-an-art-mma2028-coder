# Project Proposal

1. Roughly, what will your drawing look like
a blocky minecraft player with head, arms, legs holding a sword on right hand. 

2. What are two variables you could use so that when you change each variable, the drawing changes?
for loop, and functions

3. Where is there repetition in your drawing?
the drawing will be symmetrical, so arms and legs will be repeated but on different sides. 

4. What are the main parts of your drawing? Are there clear sections or objects?
main part maybe, will be the sword. 

5. How could you use a loop variable of a for loop? Is there somewhere in your drawing where something is repeated, but it's slightly different each time? Maybe the same object is repeated in different places, or maybe a similar object is repeated but with different sizes?

yes the body, becuase if you cut it down the middle it is just the same but like reflected on the other side.
